# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-Dashboard

Cancellation of hotel bookings causes significant revenue loss for hotels. To address this, I developed a Power BI dashboard integrated with a Machine Learning model that achieves 80% accuracy in predicting booking cancellations. This solution achieved insights on 0.28 average cancellation probability, enabling early risk identification and visual insights by hotel type, customer type, and market segment to support strategic decisions.
